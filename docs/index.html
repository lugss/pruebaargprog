                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Lourdes, a 22-year-old computer science student with a passion for coding 
                        and problem-solving. I've been fascinated by technology ever since I was a child, 
                        and I'm now pursuing my dream of becoming a software developer.<br>
                        I'm currently striving to find a balance between my modeling career and my computer 
                        science studies. In this pursuit, I find myself enjoying both of these aspects 
                        of my life.<br>
                        To further my knowledge in computer science, I've been taking online courses and working hard to improve my skills.                        
                    </p>
                </div>

            <section id="work_experience">
                <div>
                    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <p>I have experience in both business organization and the fashion industry. I have 
                        worked as a Secretary and Community Manager for Satus SA from 2019 to mid-2022, 
                        managing databases, correspondence, and social media content creation. 
                        Additionally, I was responsible for processing bills, arranging meetings, and 
                        writing reports, which required advanced text processor and Excel skills. <br> <br>
                        I have also worked as a model with various modeling agencies, including Look1 
                        Model Management, Independent Model Management in Milan, Italy, and Select Model 
                        Management in London, UK. Modeling has broadened my skillset by teaching me to 
                        hone important skills such as discipline, time management, persistence, 
                        adaptability, and teamwork.<br> <br>
                        In addition to the aforementioned work experience, I have volunteered for AFS 
                        Intercultural Programs in Buenos Aires from 2019 to 2021 acting as the Head of 
                        the Sending Area. In this volunteer work I have supervised and trained future 
                        AFS participants before going on exchange, helping them with the various 
                        application processes, and guiding their families through the experience. 
                        I also planned, organized, and directed the rest of the team. <br>
                        I was in charge of monthly reports, directing monthly meetings, delegating work to other 
                        volunteers, and working with other areas in the Chapter.This position required 
                        strong interpersonal skills, empathy, and active listening. Acting as the Head 
                        of the Sending Areas allowed  me to further develop the previously mentioned 
                        skills and as such it allowed me to further develop in the important areas of 
                        efficiency, organization, teamwork, and flexibility.
